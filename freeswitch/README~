This directory contains the support for Freeswitch.  Please be aware that this is a work under development.

We very strongly suggest running astpp-fs-xml.pl under mod_perl as in our tests it runs 10X as fast.  Here are brief instructions on accomplishing that:

1. Create a directory that will be run as mod_perl.  This could be anywhere but for our test we'll use /usr/lib/mod_perl_bin/.

2. Install mod_perl onto your server if it doesn't exist already.

3. Add the following commands into your httpd.conf file:

  Alias /perl/ /usr/lib/mod_perl_bin/
  <Location /perl/>
      SetHandler perl-script
      PerlResponseHandler ModPerl::Registry
      PerlOptions +ParseHeaders
      Options +ExecCGI
      Order allow,deny
      Allow from all
  </Location>

4. You will need to manually copy the astpp-fs-xml.pl into this folder after doing the rest of the astpp installation.

5. Point mod_xml_rpc.conf to http://localhost/perl/astpp-fs-xml.pl

6. Currently you can only use the dialplan bindings but rest assured that other bindings are coming shortly.
